# aad-sso-wordpress-mercer

This WordPress plugin customizes the [aad-sso-wordpress](https://github.com/psignoret/aad-sso-wordpress) alterations to the `wp-login.php` page.

The idea is to make it easy to do the things users should be doing most often and make it hard to do the things users should be doing least often.
